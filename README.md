****************

`P0000` is a small command line tool for fun.

    $ P0000  --number 2016 --decomposed-with 8
    2016 = 888 + 888 + 88 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8

By the way, I haven't tried to build it without IDE.

****************

**TODO LIST**

-   Add a type `power`. Like this

        $ P0000 --n 2016 -d 2 -t power
        2016 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5

-   Some model problems need thinking about.
-   Maybe I'll think of something more.
